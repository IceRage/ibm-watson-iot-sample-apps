# Sample applications using the IBM Watson IoT Platform

The current list of sample applications:

1. [01_images_from_webcam](examples/01_images_from_webcam): One application periodically captures images from a __web camera__ and sends the images to an instance of the IBM Watson IoT Platform (WIoTP) service. A second application subscribes to receiving the images captured by the first application. Each image received by the second application is displayed.
 
If you are interested in other examples please let me know and, time permitting, I will publish further sample applications here.
